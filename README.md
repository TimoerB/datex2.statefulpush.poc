# Getting Started

This repo is a poc of how the DATEXII Stateful Push webservice can be implemented using WSDL schematics. It will provide a SOAP webservice on port 8888, and is able to have a minimalistic communication with a DATEX2 SOAP supplier.

## Build

To build, simply run `mvn clean install` or to only generate sources with the _wsimport_ plugin, run `mvn clean package`
